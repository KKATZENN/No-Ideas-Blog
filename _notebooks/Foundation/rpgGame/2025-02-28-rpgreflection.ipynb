Bobby bounced around the game canvas and bounced in a random direction everytime he hit a wall. However, the size of every sprite in the game was broken, as well as the character sprite being swapped with an NPC's. \n",

    "Had our game worked, there would have been a bunch of cool features! Our player would be able to tag Bobby, and consequently highlight the person who is \"it\". This would allow the player to find out who is currently 'it\" by giving them a green border. Bobby isn't that easy to catch however, he bounces around the game area pretty quickly. By coding in a feature where the NPC moves and bounces around randomly, we make the game actually about tag! Finally, if you talk to the \"Paul\" npc, then he will increase your speed by 1.5x</p>\n",
