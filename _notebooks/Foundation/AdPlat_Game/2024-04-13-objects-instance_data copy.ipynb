    "1. In this notebook combine concept of Object Literal and Object Instance.  Use Object Literal as an intiaizer for the Object Instance.\n",
    "2. Make an array of Player object instances four or five, give them health and power, ie speed, strength, ...\n",
    "    * Make a game loop to cycle through each of the objects\n",
    "    * Each pass through the loop have a random object battle with all other objects using a random power\n",
    "    * Lower health by 1 on battle, lower health by 10 for loss\n",
    "    * Provide a leader board output each round\n",
    "    * Kill objects if their health goes to zero or less\n",
