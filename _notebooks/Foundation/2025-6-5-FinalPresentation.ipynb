    "\n",
    "Over the course of Tri 2 and 3, I have been learning loads  of different things about coding. I am now able to use my knowledge about JavaScript to create game levels with features such as transition screens, projectiles, and enemies. Working with a team also improved my communication skills and helped me learn to collaborate better with my teamates. Overall I think that I improved in all coding aspects due to this class, and I will continue to learn in the future.\n",

    "\n",
    "During NATM, my group split into 2 and presented across the table to make sure there was enough room to properly show off our game level. A few people came to look at our game, so I introduced the Adventure game as a class-collaborative game that everyone had worked together to complete. We then explained how our level functioned, from the animated and tiled creeper, our game in game platformer, gravity, randomized movement, and death animations. Overall, I believe we did a good job showcasing our game to multiple people and showing off our coding skills.\n",
